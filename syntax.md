### Variables
- Instead of making a variable  type specific, making it generic helps everyone.
```
var variablename = 2021;
```
- You can also make the variable type specific.
```
var<number> variablename = 260;
```
- Global variables
```
global var variablename = 43;
```

### Statements
- If statements
```
if (condition) {
    // code
}
else if (condition) {
    // code
} ...
else {
    // code
}
```

- While loop
```
while (condition) {
    // code
}
```

### Math operations
- Simple math operations are supported such as 
```
+   -   *   /   %
and their compound operations
+=  -=  *=  /=  %= 
++  --
```
- Bitwise operations
```
&&  ||  !   &   |   ^   ~   >>   <<
```

### Functions
- I plan the functions to work like Assembly functions, where you branch to a function and return to the next instruction.
- However, this didn't get implemented in my internship period.
